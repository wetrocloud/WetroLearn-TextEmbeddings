# Understanding Embedding Space  

This Streamlit app visualizes the embedding space of text inputs using cosine similarity. It helps users compare how similar different texts are to a reference text by mapping them in a visual space.

## Features  
- Enter a **Reference Text**, **Text-A**, and **Text-B**  
- Compute **cosine similarity** between the reference and the other texts  
- Visualize the distance in embedding space using **Plotly**  
- Uses **MiniLM-L3-v2**, a lightweight sentence transformer model  

## How It Works  
1. Enter a **Reference Text** in the input box.  
2. Enter **Text-A** and **Text-B** in their respective input boxes.  
3. Click **Analyze Texts** to compute embeddings and visualize distances.  
4. The graph will show how far **Text-A** and **Text-B** are from the reference text in embedding space.
